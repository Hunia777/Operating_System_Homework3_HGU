2. Before running
    (a) "make clean" for removing temporarilly files
    (b) "make" for compling the execting files

3. Command Options
    (a) pfind can understand your options, but can not follow.
    (b) However, you should input your command line by standard procedure due to getopt()
    (c) SOME error is occured when run pfind by only one process (Zombie issue)

4. Running.
    (a) I suggest " ./pfind -p8 /home/s21600786/OSHW3 God" . It returns sentences related "God"
    (b) If you have an error when using this program, please kill process by using "killall worker"

5. Thank you.
